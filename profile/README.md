## Welcome to LendMark's Github organisation!

We are a Czech-Slovak Minecraft server network and a team of people focused on quality and player satisfaction with a strong community and a variety of original game modes! If you are tired of classic Oneblock, PvP or other low quality servers that copy each other, we are here for you!

Here you will find some of our open-source repositories with code we use on our network, as well as bug reports, our plans for the future and more!
